### Overview

Michael Lansford majored in Computational Biology and Mathematics at the University of Rochester. He worked on modeling gene regulatory networks in cancer cells. He is now a third-year PhD student in Human Genetics at the University of Utah working in the Pezzolesi lab. His projects include studying the longitudinal Utah Kidney Study cohort, determining potential genetic risk factors for rapid renal decline through a GWAS on the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC), and contributing to efforts on uncovering population-specific genetic variants potentially conferring risk for diabetic complications among Pacific Islanders in Utah.
