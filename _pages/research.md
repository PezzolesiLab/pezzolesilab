## The Familiality of Rapid Renal Decline in Diabetes
<div style="text-align: justify">
Despite significant advances in the management of diabetes, including widespread implementation of renoprotective therapies when indicated, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the U.S. and is associated with excess morbidity and mortality.

Progressive glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline precedes ESRD and has recently been established as the predominant clinical feature of DKD. For some patients with DKD, renal function declines gradually, whereas others experience a sudden decline, quickly reach ESRD (defined by a GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2), and require renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or the receipt of a functioning kidney through donor transplantation to survive. Despite interindividual variability, renal function decline progresses at a steady, or linear, rate over the course of DKD. In addition, those with more rapid renal decline have higher risk of all-cause mortality.

Wide individual variation in the rate of progression of renal function decline in diabetes has motivated recent studies to identify biomarkers that are associated with or predictive of rapid renal decline. Such biomarkers may have utility in patient surveillance and management. In addition to studies examining proteomic, metabolomic, and environomic profiles associated with renal decline in diabetes, various studies are also underway to identify genetic factors that contribute to its risk. Although these genetic studies are likely to be more powerful than previous studies that have examined a spectrum of DKD phenotypes, the familial risk of rapid renal decline has not been investigated. Understanding the familiality of rapid renal decline is paramount to recognizing the magnitude of the influence of shared factors, both environmental and genetic, on rapid renal decline.

To advance this area of research, we set out to investigate the familial nature of progressive renal function decline in diabetes using the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a unique research resource that links genealogical data to electronic health record data. Through this population-based retrospective cohort study, we show that there is strong evidence of familial clustering of rapid renal decline. Our findings support the hypothesis that shared familial factors (e.g., shared environmental and genetic factors) play a role in its susceptibility.

## A dominant negative ADIPOQ mutation in a diabetic family with renal disease, hypoadiponectinemia, and hyperceramidemia
<div style="text-align: justify">
Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone with pleiotropic actions that promote insulin sensitivity, inhibit cell death, and decrease inflammation. Adiponectin forms an obligate trimer and circulates as trimers, hexamers, and high-molecular weight multimers that target various tissues and cell types, including liver, kidney, cardiac myocytes, and pancreatic β cells. Levels of adiponectin are decreased in obesity and may contribute to a chronic state of inflammation that leads to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and kidney disease. Recently, the antiapoptotic, insulin-sensitizing, glucose lowering, anti-inflammatory, and anti-steatotic effects of adiponectin have been linked to its role in sphingolipid metabolism and its receptor-mediated activation of ceramidase activity, which reduce levels of lipotoxic ceramides.

Previous studies have identified common variants in or near ADIPOQ, the gene that encodes adiponectin, that are associated with aberrant adiponectin levels, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and diabetic kidney disease. Rare ADIPOQ amino acid substitution mutations have also been reported in individuals with diabetes and hypoadiponectinemia. Here, we describe the first multigenerational family with a protein-truncating mutation in ADIPOQ (p.Gly93GlufsTer73), diabetes, and end-stage renal disease. Carriers of this mutation have dramatically reduced circulating adiponectin and increased long-chain ceramide levels. Functional studies show that this mutation acts via a dominant negative mechanism, with the wild-type and mutant proteins interacting, leading to decreased levels of cellular and secreted adiponectin. Our findings support adiponectin’s protective role and suggest that its genetic loss leads to ceramide accumulation which, in turn, contributes to diabetes and progression of renal disease.
